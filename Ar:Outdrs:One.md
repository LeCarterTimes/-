# Flintknapping

 Flintknapping. It's a word that you've not heard very often, or, even at all. Well I want to change that, because flintknapping is awesome! Some of you watching may ask “well what is flintknapping exactly?” Well, flintknapping is just as it sounds, it is the process of knapping a piece of flint or glass-like material into a tool or weapon with a rock, a metal tool, or anything else that's heavy! But wait, why would you want to do that if you can have metal tools? Well the answer is because metal is, well, hard to get. And that's not even taking into account that with metal you have to find it, mine it, melt it AND cast it into form, but with flintknapping you only have to  find a rock, and hit it!. But wait though, who even created flintknapping? Well the answer is, everyone! Flintknapping has its origins found all the way back to our very first ancestors when metal was hard to find or non-existent and examples have been found from every culture all over earth!  And while metal is effective and affordable today, flintknapping still hits home. If you need a traditional tool that is fast, cheap and easy to make and is found everywhere then flintknapping is right for you!

“Wait a minute, did i hear you just say i could use glass?'' Well yes you did! The reason that you can even use flint and obsidian is as opposed to, oh i don't know, sandstone, is because of the property that flint possesses is that flint, while being formed, has lots of little crystal particles being formed and stacked on top of each other creating a kind of easley fragmentable net of glass that, while still a solid rock, would crack into thin large flakes that could be easily shaped into something beautiful and deadly. But, while flint is cool, you gotta give other rocks more credit! Other rocks that were formed in a very similar way, including but not limited to, quarts, some types of crystal, obsidian, glass, and even porcelain all contain similar properties because of their forming that allow them to be shaped by humans. Now although obsidian is technically a natural glass, it is still shaped in volcanos with a similar property, that is melting rocks into crystal like shapes and forming a rock, which is  in fact that is why you can use glass and porcelain to make arrowheads because of the fact that they were formed in the same way!
