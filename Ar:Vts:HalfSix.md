# My review of half the 6th chapter of ‘Visualizing the Sacred’

#### Something I am really interested in is the image of the great serpent. Things like what it represents, what it was used for, and the different styles it can take. I hope to learn more about it and the things it can represent, so I do somewhat enjoy reading this chapter because it talks specifically about it and the things it represents, so if that's interesting to you to, i totally recommend reading the book. or you can just continue reading my articles if that suits your fancy as well. Either way, please sit back and relax and enjoy this series, thanks!

Something that's really interesting to me is that a lot of pottery produced in the lower Mississippi valley contains a lot of imagery of a ‘great winged serpent with deer antlers’. This image is thought to have been from Moundville, the second largest mississippian city on the account of cahokia, and is actually in the lower mississippi valley. There does seem to be an evolution to this style however, as the images seen in the general lower Mississippi valley usually have lots of mythic creatures and figures in addition to the winged serpent, while moundville does not.

One reason for the great serpent occurring on many of these vessels is that these bottles had the great serpent drawn on them specifically to indicate that they were to be used in a serpent related ritual or ceremony. Another may have been that they held medicine in them that was to be used in the serpent ritual, as opposed to holding a sacred object used in the ritual, like sacred earth or something that they would be using in the ritual. Maybe the serpent drawn on the bottles were used to mark a specific type of medicine, not just for the use in serpent related ceremonies.

Although something that I find interesting is that there are around ten styles of winged serpents that have been categorized by a computer system, counting things like eye shape, wing shape, and body patterns found on the serpent images. One theory states that these styles may have represented different legends or myths about the winged serpent. Another states that the style variations may have been signatures of certain artists, or that they may have been specific styles from different workshops but i am really not sure.

 I do hope that we can find out the answer to if they were from a specific workshop or artist. I also hope we can find out what they were used for, like in ceremony or medicine, or even if we can say for sure what the great winged serpent represented. But honestly, I'm not sure we can know the answer with current technology,but I hope we will soon. If you liked this post, go ahead and look at another while you're here, Thanks!
