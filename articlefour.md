#### Now this might come as a shock, but I am human. I need human things, and I honestly have human things going on in my life. So if you are human as well, go ahead and support me on my youtube channel, LeCarterTimes to stay up to date on some of the things that are going on in the world and my world. Things like music, literature, politics and much more. Now I was going to say something about getting up late but….. WAIT, I just thought of something. Oh my what was it….. Something about music or a game or something….. No that can't be it….it.. WAIT, GOT IT!!

Something that I am honestly somewhat proud about is today I was able to wake up really quite early! I was up so early I had time to get some cornbread for breakfast before doing some of my work, as opposed to eating only after I had done my work. Something that was actually nice was being scared about my work and thinking “omg! I am late getting my work done!” but then i realized the day has barely even started.

But something I am more excited about is that I learned a new song on my trumpet! The song is called “major duple '' and it's quite honestly very simple, it has no word for some reason but it has a neat little rhythm. I will be posting a video of my playing said song to my youtube channel LeCarterTimes soon keep an eye out! But this does mean i'll have to move along to another song soon though so you'll have to look out for a second video as well!

But something i would like to show is a card game i invented called “diplomacy” and i am really excited to finally write about it. Now its not your average card game, not a poker or a solitaire for sure. It's a somewhat complex way to model population moving from their original lands to others in a way that mimics historical population and social development, with 2 or more decks of playing cards! I will again be posting about this game on my youtube channel, so go ahead and look out for that as well.

If that card game simulation sounds cool to you, go ahead and look it up on youtube, or (hopefully) i will go ahead and add them to my site for ease and convenience. If you like things to do with politics, food, literature or music go ahead and look at some of our other articles, thanks!
