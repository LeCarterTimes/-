# Journal 04

#### hi! Thanks for clicking this article, I will be talking about some very exciting things!
First off, I have created a brand new youtube channel, LeCarterTimes! If you are interested in diy, politics, cooking or anything else in that vein, check it out! Second off, i have acquired some new music, and third off, i have made another crack at the impossible cornbread problem. 

“Something amazing has happened” I say, “what is it? I AM DYING to know! ” and I say, " I learned a song called perot!” I say, and you, in complete and utter awe, start bowing down to me. But in all seriousness though, I did learn a song called perot. It's a short little song, and I'll be posting it on my youtube channel as well as a tutorial for how to sing it soon.

But something that is much more important, cornbread. And more specifically my new recipe iteration in the advanced field of cornbread recipes. Now this new recipe seems to have improved slightly, as now you don't NEED water or iced tea to swallow it because it's so dry, but it is highly recommended, and I will also be posting the recipe on my channel as well.

something you may be thinking about however, is “holy, why won't this guy shut up about his youtube channel already?”. Well the answer is that, well, i have a new youtube channel! It's called LeCarterTimes, and you can find it on youtube!(thankfully) I will be posting weekly if not more and will post a range of topics, including music, games, cooking, DIY and much more! Come and check it out!

If you enjoy the work I do, like writing about music, then please go ahead and share this with a friend! Or if you enjoy me writing about things like cornbread, or just cooking things in general, then go ahead and visit my channel, LeCarterTimes on youtube! Or if you are interested in the other things my site will be posting about, go ahead and look at some of our other articles, Cheers!
