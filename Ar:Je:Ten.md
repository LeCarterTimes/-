#### Hhmm, what to think about, what to think about, ppffhhhh. OH! I got it! The last article that was published was on friday evening, right before Shabbat! Hhhmmm…. What did i do after that? Oh yeah! I actually went on a rerally long hike with a family member, it was real fun. I actually have a get together to get to in three days,so watch out for a article about that, plus i gotta make some cornbread to take, so thats gonna be two new videos for ya’ll!

Ok so first off shalom! I hope everyone seeing this had a good and restful Shabbat/saturday.
I pretty much just chilled out for the day, and didnt really go anywhere, overall, a 10/10 shabbat!
The next day however, that was fun. Me a family member went on a hike with some friends on sunday, we walked 6 miles! I honestly cant believe that i made it!

But a little bit of a downside to all this relaxation is that today, monday, i have been super slow! I mean with all of this stuff that i did on shabbat, i didnt do my reutine, which has not helped me today. But whatever, there is always tomarrow! I am gonna have to do my work anyway, so might as well get it done fast!

But aside from all that, i gotta prep for thanksgiving! I am going to go to a party on thursday, and i am supposed to bring some homemade cornbread, but the problem is, my cornbread sucks! So that means i am going to have to improve on the recipe, meanin what better of a time to make some videos on cornbread recipes that in these next two days!

In the meantime however, i will have to be editing a LOT and getting all my work done, plus making some gifts for some people, so i am probably going to have to get more efficiant! But aside from that, If you like these of blogs about things in my personel life like making cornbread, my shabbat, and prepping for thanksgiving, then go ahead and share this article with a friend. If you wanna see more of these types of things, have a look at some of our other articles while you’re here, Thanks!
