#### Ok so this is gonna  be a little short. I don't have a lot of news, only that i got to see some family, i was having kind of a hard time focusing, and i changed a light on my keyboard. Other than that, not a ton, for that you'll have to read some of our other articles!

Alright so first things first, i gotta finish up with this stuff! I am under quite honestly a time constraint, as I need to go see a family member in a little bit. Now this is a problem, because i am not done with my work yet.I swear my eyes have been hurting for an hour or two now, so much so i didn't notice an hour go by while I was just staring into space.

 This is more than a little annoying because I was supposed to be done with my stuff two hours ago! Something that is interesting though is I have a big keyboard, and this keyboard has two functions. Just pure red light, and a moving rainbow.

Now I had this keyboard in pure red, but I decided to switch it to rainbow. And I swear, my eyes felt literally lighter and I could focus enough to write this. I have heard of such a phenomenon where you are more stressed because of a red light, but it has never happened to me like this before!

But aside from that, my  main worry is doing a little bit more work and getting ready to go see my family. If you like content like this, namely what i got to do today, my worries about getting ready, and the weird effects of red light, then i implore you to check out another article while you are here. If you just want to show us some love, then go on ahead and share this article with a friend Thanks!
