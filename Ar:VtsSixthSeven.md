# Review of the sixth part of the seventh chapter of Visualizing the Sacred.

#### So this ones gonna be a little short, with me only talking about a few things. Some of those things are some interesting shell carvings found at the Spiro site, a possible connection between that and the Thruston tablet, and my honest opinion of what I think about this idea. Without adieu, let's get into it!

Something interesting that this book mentions is an engraved shell cup from Spiro (Oklahoma).
On this engraved shell cup, there are two men, one wearing a woven tunic and the other wearing an animal tunic. This cup is thought to represent a variation of a ‘twins story’  about a pair of magical twins, often doing some kind of adventure.

Now the reason I bring this up is on the Thruston tablet there are three sets of two people, one wearing a woven tunic and the other an animal tunic. This raises a good point, are the figures on the Thruston tablet a representation of the twins? Well if you have been following along with these reviews, you will know that the place where the Thruston tablet was found was tennessee, and spiro Oklahoma is VERY far from tennessee. 

Now it is possible for these two things to be related, but I don't think so. I say this because the twins are supposed to be twins, and in every story I've heard they are allies, not enemies. The Thruston tablet would go against this however, as it clearly shows the two figures fighting with an ax and a spear, with one clearly blocking hits from the ax with his shield.

That's all for my review of the sixth part of the seventh chapter.
