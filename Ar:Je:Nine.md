#### You know, I'm hitting kind of a block. I am finding it hard to think about what to write about. Maybe I could write about being energized? No, that won't work. Hmm. Maybe something about shabbat? Eh, I'm not sure. Or maybe something about how I'm feeling? hmmm…..

Hhhmm… something to write about, somethings to write about….. Hhhmmmm…
OH! I KNOW! I actually feel pretty great today, because I actually got most of my work done today! Ok well not all of it, but enough to celebrate my good time. 

I honestly think it's because I woke up early and got a little cup of coffee to help wake me up. I swear, that stuff can do miracles! But anyway, I was still able to wake up early enough and get energized enough to get my stuff done. Hooray!

Now something I am looking forward to is being able to bake some bread. More specifically, challah! It is somewhat of an event for us, because I don't bake bread that often, but I want this shabbat to be special. I WILL be posting a video on it soon, so watch out!

If you like to hear my opinion and just how my day is going, I appreciate you for looking at this article! If you like these kinds of things, like getting to celebrate my awakening, my work being basically decimated, and my plans for challah on shabbat, then go ahead and share this article with a friend! And if you want to see more, then go ahead and look at another one of our articles here at LeCarterTimes, Thanks!
