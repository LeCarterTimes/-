# My review of two thirds of chapter six of ‘Visualizing the Sacred’

### something that fascinates me and obviously F. Kent Reilly lll is the LMV. more specifically the methods used to find these things, and i personally really enjoy reading this book. Something that amazes me though, is the scale at which it was inhabited. I mean that this thing went from Illinois to arkansas! Plus this place must have just been jammed packed with people, too. But if you're like me, you just like learning things. So without adieu, let's get into it!

Something that I find really cool is the method archaeologists use to understand meaning from ancient things. It really fascinates me how these archaeologists were able to deduce that, without even being alive in ancient times, were able to understand that some of these vessels were used to contain medicine for the dead, which was to help them get past the great serpent which is on the bottle in the afterlife. And although this is still a theory, it still fascinates me how our perception of art today can give us ideas about what people were thinking about way back then.

Although something I have personally  been wondering about is where the LMV (Lower Mississippi Valley) was actually situated. Well now I have the answer! The lower Mississippi Valley was situated between southern Illinois and Missouri, all the way down the Mississippi river (on both sides) all the way down to the Arkansas River's mouth. It's really interesting that this sub-cultural zone covered such a large territory!

Although something that is really cool is the fact that the LMV was apparently the most heavily populated area in the entire eastern woodlands! This extends from Illinois to georgia! The area around Memphis was so populated that it was hard to tell where one village started and another ended. Really crazy stuff!

Now I do hope you enjoyed hearing about the methods archaeologists use, where the LMV ACTUALLY is, and just how densely packed it all was! If you enjoyed his article, go ahead and share it with a friend, and if you're new or this your first one you've read, go ahead and look at the previous ones, thanks!
