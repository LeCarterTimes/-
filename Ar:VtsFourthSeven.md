# Fourth part of the seventh chapter of ‘Visualizing the Sacred’

#### Something I like to do is try to understand things. I love trying to understand things like how a story is understood based on where its elements are set, other people's theories about how the story flowed, and my own theory about how the story may have sounded. I honestly love trying to understand these things, and if you do, go ahead and read articles like this to get a short overview of these things. Without adieu, let's hop right in!

So on the Thruston tablet there are three sets of two characters, These are all a part of the foreground, which is one of the three layers that were classified on the tablet. There are three sets of characters, each named 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Two of the three seem to be battling in some way, although one set seems to be doing nothing off to the side, with one character smoking a pipe and another just standing watching, but one set is somewhat misunderstood, with two people seemingly high fiving, although I think they are fighting.

Now the people who wrote this chapter, and yes, there are multiple, have set forth a theory that the people are actually just two people, with each set of characters seemingly just another scene of the same fight. I think this is incorrect however, as all of the figures do seem to have the same motifs on them, like the same type of clothes and symbols, but each figure has these things like tattoos and symbols in vastly different places. This has made me come to the conclusion that these are in fact two different sets of people fighting, and the book has also come to this conclusion to, like an army, they all have the same uniform  and rifle, but they each have different faces and hair, it is the same here.

Something interesting however, is the fact that all the figures all have different headdresses. This could be to represent different social classes, meaning that the stone has a totally different meaning than what we may have thought. It is my theory that these people may be doing a game or composition, with the similarities between the peoples like their types of clothing being a marker of specific tribes, and the set of characters on the side being the leaders watching the people trying to see who will win.

Now I don't know about you, but this is SUPER interesting. I implore you then, if you like things like trying to understand the positioning of certain characters, trying to understand the story being shown, and another possible theory as to what the tablet is trying to tell us, then go ahead and share this article with a friend, or look at another while you're here! Thanks for sticking with me through this article, have a good one!
