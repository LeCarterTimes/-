# My review of the 5th chapter of ‘Visualizing the Sacred’

#### It's really fun to learn new things, especially how they are tracked. But it's always funny when someone or a group of people completely miss an entire trove of info because they just didn’t  wanna think about it. That's what I wanna talk about, but i also wanna say something about the method of actually tracking this thing, as well as the difficulty in classifying it! So come along with me as I give you a tour of some of the points that stuck out to me in this chapter!

Ok so first off Something crazy that i just read is Waring and Holder, some of the founding guys of the term S.E.C.C (southeastern ceremonial complex) did not include pottery in their definition of secc and so therefore did not classify the entire Lower Mississippi valley as important, because the lower mississippi valley almost entirely manufactured pottery, not copper or shell. This is crazy because both one it's an entire vast area that they didn't include because it didn't fit with their idea of a southern cult, and two the lower mississippi valley had lots of specific motifs and symbols that are similar to the secc material! It's just crazy to me that they skipped over this area just because it didn't back the cult idea and because they considered pottery to be utilitarian and not special enough.

Although something I like about pottery is the ease that you can track when and where it's from. What I mean by this is you can track the style that it was made in and therefore see when it was made. Pottery can be so eloquent yet so telling at the same time, I love it!

Something that is very intriguing about classifying where pottery is from however is the phenomenon that occurs when you try to classify it into specific categories. Pottery design has no clear cut borders, more just style centers. So when trying to classify them into their own categories, the categories get smaller and smaller, and this in turn makes it harder to recognize themes that the pottery retains, even through the other changes that it goes through. 

I honestly find that this section written by David H. Dye is quite intriguing, especially the part about the trouble trying to categorize different styles. But more than anything i enjoy just seeing other people's views and the fields they've written about, i mean just the way about tracking where and when the pottery came from is intriguing, let alone the just ridiculousness of Waring and Holder's methods of classification of materials.
