# Second part of the seventh chapter of ‘Visualizing the Sacred’

#### Something I find interesting is the history the tablet has gone through. What I mean by this is the people who have made theories about what the tablet means, the astounding level of carelessness gone into preserving it, and the apparent initials scratched onto it. I really appreciate all those who read this, so without adieu, let's get into it!

Now the man who the Thruston tablet was named after, Gates P. Thruston, is credited with being the first to study the Thruston tablet at length. From his observations, he made the claim that the figures on the tablet were chiefs, conducting a peace agreement. This is not only incorrect but is also  just plain ignorant, with weapons clearly being used against one another on the tablet and two people in a fist fight.

Some of these things may be hard to see however, largely due to the reckless handling of the tablet. A worker tasked with handling and preserving the stone apparently tried to put varnish on the tablet which, obviously, was not a wise decision. Not only was the thing he did next unwise but it was also just plain stupid. This man apparently tried to SAND the varnish off, which was obviously the worst course of action to do when working with highly erodible limestone.

Something else of note is the apparent initials on the tablet, and yes you heard me right, initials. The initials read out “HS” on the tablet, and it is unknown who actually made them. We are pretty sure however, that the stone is authentic because the lines chiseled into the stone have been dated to about the 14th century, although it was added onto many times.
