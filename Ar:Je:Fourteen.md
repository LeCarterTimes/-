#### Not a ton to report on, just some news about getting ready for the holidays. I have to return a book to a relative, In Plain Sight, by Gloria Farley. I have to learn two new songs, and I wish I had been faster. If you're interested, let's get right into it!

Ok What I have planned for December is I am going to start reading at least one chapter a day, if not more of ‘In Plain Sight’ by Gloria Farley, as I am borrowing the book from a family member. I have to give it back at Christmas, so  I gotta read read read!

Something else I have to do is learn two new Christmas songs, by christmas! I am probably not going to be posting anything for December, like videos, but who knows! Otherwise though, not a lot of news on the musical front. 

I hope to get my day done quickly, as it is one o'clock and I still have to do some work. I hope to get everything done quickly, so I can relax and not have to worry about my work. I wish I had gone faster, but I'm still going to be happy about this.

So not a lot going on, but I still hope this is entertaining. If you like things like me talking about how I want to be quicker, how I need to learn two new songs, and an update on a book i ambarrowing, then go ahead and check out another article while you're here!
