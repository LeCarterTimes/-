You know, I really enjoy this book. I just enjoy being able to be nitpicky about the theories that the authors put forward, the artistic ability that this ancient person must have had, and some of the challenges the Thruston tablet has faced, in the sense of it still being readable. If you like this kind of thing too, then let's jump right into it!

Something that I find interesting is the way the background looks. By the background i mean the three images at seemingly different ends of the tablet. These images that were carved into the rock are much more faded than the foreground, which is most visible out of the two

Perhaps because of the level of depth, or the lack thereof, is a sign of heavy weathering endured by the stone. This is plausible because it was found next to a creek, and the people who first discovered it and kept it, even though they worked for a museum, heavily destroyed it, and in one instance even sanded some of it down. Another simpler theory is that these less precise and less deep lines may have just been someone practicing shapes and images, as many of the images do not make sense. 

One of these images in the background, clearly shows a group of people with half their body covered by a horizontal line. Now this has been suggested to be a viking longboat, but the location of where the stone was found does not make sense for a viking longboat to be there. Although an equally ridiculous idea is that this was not a boat at all but a gathering hut. Now they gave an example of an ojibwe meating house which does not make sense. This does not make any sense because the ojibwe lived far up north, and weren't even a part of mississippian culture. 

All that aside though, I do really enjoy reading this book. If you want to support me, go ahead and share this with a friend. If you like this kind of content, like researching the artistic style of the person who carved this stone, the possible erosion it may have faced, or the theories put forth by the experts in this field, then go ahead and look at another article while you're here, Thanks!
