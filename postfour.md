# My review of the 4th chapter of ‘Visualizing the Sacred’


Visualizing the Sacred really is an interesting book, it talks about several things, but right now i really just want to focus on three: The way people made rock carvings have certain meanings, the symbols and their meanings that were carved into the rock, and traditions of actually deciphering these rock faces.


Now when you see ancient rock carvings, you may think to yourself, “huh, i wonder what it means”, well some people actually have some theories! The way that this would have spread is there would be a certain symbol or symbols attached to a certain idea or story, so someone would have had to write this down somewhere, and some did. Some wrote it down on shells, pottery, or other materials but the way that some people wrote these things down is they wrote them in stone!

Now when these people wrote these things down on stone they had a specific idea about what they wanted to write, and some of these include: a cross in a circle, often times seen as the sun and also present on the cherokee water spider, a birdman or falcon man, a bilobed arrow, snakes, and water spirits just to name a few. Now these symbols according to Visualizing the Sacred meant one specific thing or another based off osage and some other tribes oral traditions, but i think this is extremely biased. The man who wrote this took notes and oral traditions from the Dhengian's, a collecrion of western tribes, and granted he did think that the Dhengian’s had kickstarted mississippian culture, but my point still stands that i think that this is a biased view based off of the fact that you can't just take one group of people and say “alright, since your belief seems most likely, i'm going to say all of these symbols are from your religion” I think this is unfair and unrealistic, because the Etowah indian mounds and Cahokia are NOT close to each other, believe me!

But perhaps a better question is why? Why are those things even there in the first place? Well this book actually does give a pretty fair idea of why those carvings were even put there in the first place. The reason is that these things were often put in very specific places such as at cave openings or on boulders is because people would use them to tell stories. Now they would do this via using oral tradition and using the glyphs as reference points to say “look, that's what he looked like”. “But how or why would they put them at the entrances to caves, i thought natives did not live in caves” I hear you asking, Well the answer is they would also put them at the entrance to caves because the caves could be a place to keep things from being destroyed by the weather, or they could be ceramonial or sacred grounds or just a cool place to meet. We can't always be sure, but it sure is neat!

I hope you can have an appreciation now for the wonderful and quite honestly barely understood world of where or people would have made carvings, what some of the symbols were and what they could have meant, or just plain why they would have done it! 
But if you like this article, please go ahead and look at another I have in this series, Thnx!
