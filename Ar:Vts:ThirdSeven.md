# Third part of the seventh chapter of ‘Visualizing the Sacred’

#### I actually kind of like the dedication  of these guys, especially because they just got things done. What I mean by this is these guys really went ham about thoroughly researching this thing, although one of the methods they used is questionable, but not worse than what was done to it before! But in all seriousness though, let's just get into it

I honestly really enjoy hearing people actually going and doing things. What I mean is this team, fed up with seeing only semi good photos and illustrations of the Thruston tablet, actually went and studied it at the Tennessee State museum in Nashville. Imagine doing that, just going and having fun analyzing artifacts very meticulously. It seems so fun!

Something that does put a little bit of a damper on this however, is the fact that the team used rubbing paper to try to rub the lines from the stone onto it. It just seems somewhat ironic to me that in this book, they were to some extent criticizing the sloppy method of those who handled it, like drawing on it and sanding it, but then go and rub a bunch of paper all over it. You probably wouldn't want to do this on a hard stone like granite, but especially not basically faded edged lines on a slab of limestone!

But wait, I hear you say, someone drew on it?? Well yes, someone did. Apparently it occurred sometime in the 50’s, with one source claiming that it was not drawn in until 1949, and another published in the 60’s said it was sometime in the 50’s. The research team did find remnants of ink drawn into the historic stone. It truly sucks what some people will do to artifacts like this.

Well that's my opinion and observations about the second part of chapter seven (i am just reading shorter parts of it now, as opposed to the entire chapter). If you like things like this, such as people just getting the thing done, their somewhat ironic attempts to analyze the Thruston tablet, and just the horrendous things people do to artifacts, go ahead and share this article.if you want to see more, go ahead and check out some more of our articles, thanks!
