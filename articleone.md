# THREE THINGS ABOUT MATH

#### Three things about math isn't just three things about math like the title may suggest, i really am just writing this to get my feelings about it out about it, like the feeling of ease you can get while following all the rules, the proud-ness that you feel after making it, and just the feelings and personnel challenges that you get while trying to do it. Math is something that creates interest, something that can make someone feel awe at the complexity yet beauty of it, and something that can quite honestly be a hobby, but without a doubt, math is something that inspires. So without a doubt, let's get creative!

Something that i enjoy about math is the simple formula that it always follows. While studying it, it always every time gives me a sense of awe to see when you follow the rules exactly and an answer gets spit back out like a machine. What I mean by this is while following all the rules of algebra (pemdas) you can start to see it grow like a baby from the starting position with all its stages in between to an adult and its final answer. It's  like seeing a tamagotchi growing, except it's much more complex and in my opinion much fun because you get to actually build it.

Something else I enjoy about algebra is the ease of operation. What I mean is when I'm doing equations, if I follow the rules correctly I speed through it like a knife through butter. Sometimes though i do think “but why do algebra, it's not like this can have any real world applications” well that's completely wrong, because i've seen problems where you can solve things like what altitude your plane is at or how fast can you run in one mile or supply and demand in a business, and  I honestly have to remind myself while reading these problems that they’re algebra in the first place because they seem so simple in real world applications!

But liking the way algebra flows or envisioning it as your child isn't all algebra is good for, there's  also a complexity to it that is in my opinion unmatched by a lot of other kinds of math because algebra can get so complicated sometimes it's hard to follow! You will see often that there are these mathematicians who will have huge whiteboards full of weird math equations, but in reality these are often only one math problem! You  might be saying to yourself right now, “but how do they do that?” well the answer is that they use PEMDAS, an acronym that seems daunting but is really simple: parentheses, exponents, multiplication, division, addition and subtraction. There are of course other principles (many of which I need to learn) but pemdas still remain the same.
  
But i'm no young athletic god, (ok maybe a little god like) i still find math hard! Something that I HATE while doing math is that feeling where you just can't understand the problem itself even though it seems so easy! Like for example i read something that was like “how many bottles do you need to recycle in order to make x square foot of carpet?”, and i swear i read that like 3-4 times before i got it, then i was like “ooooohh, why am i so dumb?”  but that's just part of the process, I've learned. Sometimes something so dumb and little can stump you forever.

Something else I don't like is the feeling when your eyes lose focus and you have to strain to get them to focus but you just get a micro headache instead! I mean like it just sucks! But at the end of the day i still have to recognize that, however much i don't like math, or however much i feel disheartened, i still have to just get it done or i wont have information for later.

Although this does make it IMPOSSIBLE to get work done: you walk in, get ready to do it but you just get nervous, so you say; “ok, i'll do my math as soon as i get a candy bar” you get a candy bar and a cup of water, then you sit back down and say “ok but let me go to the bathroom” then you go to the bathroom, then instead of doing work you just start procrastinating,(because that's what your doing at this point) playing games, eating snacks, and getting nothing done. Then finally the end of the day rolls around and you get to bed, mentally cry a little, and go to sleep. My advice, actually get the work done, say to yourself “i'll give myself a candy bar after i do my work” and you'll feel great.

Well those are my opinions about  how I feel about math, the simplicities of it,the feeling of pride that you get from making it, and the problems and just straight obstacles that you can experience when doing it.
