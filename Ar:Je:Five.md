# Journal entry 05

### I honestly need to get faster with my stuff. What I mean by this is I've been going so slow with my work! Today, at the time of writing this, my work is supposed to be almost over! I am supposed to: make bread, finish updating this site, and get another video up for my channel, LeCarterTimes and so much more! But I still have to remind myself, I gotta just keep on going to get what I want.

“But really though, what do I want?” says the inner monologue. “Well what i want to do is eat some good cornbread” i say back to myself, and i then reply “cornbread? Where on god's green earth would you get that?” then i said back to myself ”at the store maybe?” but then i realize that i can't do that because the stuff at the store is basically bleach. So i wonder to myself, ”huh i guess i'll just have to make it” “make it? HOW?” I replied, then I said to myself “you can easily make it yourself by watching my tutorial on youtube for how to actually make good cornbread!” “wow that sounds amazing, i'll definitely watch it!” “Thanks,” I say, excitedly writing the rest of this article out but, still quite hungry. 

But something that can maybe distract me from my hunger is thinking about the update of this site. That's right, this baby is in the mist of an update! I will be updating the look and feel of the site's main page, so as to have it more organized than before, without a bunch  of links on a central page but now in specific hubs. That's right, you can go to your favorite hub in LeCarterTimes! But I am still just so hungry.


So i think, “huh, ok maybe if i work on making a video i could focus and not be so hungry.” so i think, “but what will this video be about?” then it hits me. I will make a video about a card game that's purpose is to simulate civilizations but also the ethnic, cultural and political aspects of it. Now I still should probably make it (check it out on my channel, if you want) but I'm still just so darn hungry!
 
But as I sit there, pondering about the true meaning of existence and why it has made me so darn hungry, I realize something. What if I just got some food. And I lived happily ever after. Now if you are hungry, I would recommend my video about how to make cornbread, but if you're not, I would personally recommend that, if you were interested in this article, you go and look at another while you're here, thanks!
