# My review of the 3rd chapter of Visualizing The Sacred


Hi! Thanks for reading this article about Visualizing the sacred. I should probably say that this is a third hand report from in hand a second hand report by a settler who supposedly lived among the osage, but i do still want to talk about how the omaha had five sky clans and 5 earth clans, or how the osage believed in the sky representing a man/north and the earth representing women/south, or how the osage were patrilineal, or any of the other fascinating subjects of the Dhegiha tribes. But what I most want to talk about is just the immense complexity of Dhegihan culture, so without a doubt, let's get into it!


Something I always like to learn about is how other tribes do things and govern their land, so it is very cool to learn about how the omaha tribe governed their land with a tribal system where there were 5 sky clans and 5 earth clans. Each of which was responsible for specific duties and rituals in the tribe, but something interesting is there were these ‘sub clans’ where there were specific people or lineages that had special duties within the tribe. The members of said ‘sub clans’ would put special markers outside their tents to mark who they were and what they did.

Now this is a third hand account from white settlers but I do think it's important to tell. From what I have read the osage/omaha tribes belief system was heavily centered on the idea of north/south or sky and earth. The directions in which things face and align seems to be very important to their culture, as is evidenced by the way that their camps were set up, with certain clans having specific places in the camp. The way they set up the camp  left room for the sun to travel from east to west through the camp and directly over a sacred pole in the middle of the camp. Very interesting to read about.

Something that is REALLY interesting to learn about is the fact that the osage was patrilineal!
This is something that I personally haven't seen very often within native societies but is really cool to learn about. something i do have to take in mind is that this is a second hand account from a white settler that i am reading so i really don't know if he truly fully understood what they meant when they told him that, as there may have been other indigenous customs that were not conveyed that may separate it from other traditional patrilineal european societies that the author was accustomed to.


Now I hope you can have an appreciation for the Dhegihan tribes, because they're just so fascinating! Just the way in which they set up their camp to follow the directions,  how their tribe was divided into clans that had specific duties, or how they were patrilineal is honestly so cool!
