# Chapter two of ‘In Plain Sight’ by Gloria Farley

#### I may say to you, “hey do you know when contact was first made between the old world and the new?” and you would probably say “yeah, it was Columbus”, but what if i told you it was long before that, possibly longer then 4700 years ago. You would probably tell me i was crazy and just walk past, but there is some really compelling evidence, some of which i’m about to tell you: 1, how there has been a certain metal tablet discovered, 2, rock carvings that prove sea going vessels had come to north america, and 3, proof you can still make the crossing today.

First off, this evidence of early people comes in the form of an ancient lead tablet. This lead tablet is important because it details the sacrifice of animals to two Syrian gods. This tablet gives the name of the person writing it, Enlila, the province she was from, Shulgi, Iraq, and it has been dated to 2500 BC. This tablet was found when a woman tried to dig a hole in her backyard in Georgia.

You may say to yourself however, “ok, that's just a coincidence, someone could have taken it from iraq and deposited it there a long time ago, i mean, it's not like they could have just sailed from iraq to Georgia'' well yes, yes they could've. It has been proven many times in recent history, particularly from the 50’s to 80’s that you can get across the atlantic on just about anything that floats. There are several examples of this with people going all the way from Britain to America and vice versa in things like kayaks, and even a water board.

Something else that is quite interesting is the fact that ancient people in America actually recorded these crossings in stone. There have been many pictures found over the years carved in stone of large ocean going vessels, with masts and everything. A lot of the time these images contain letters, particularly in languages like iberian, punic, ogam and more. This can be done with english as well, you can draw BOAT in a way that it shows a boat.

Many of these scripts and images have been deciphered, and many have not. It is truly amazing the things you can learn from studying. If you like content like the proof that people in North America knew what boats were, that the voyage is not only possible but universal to anything that floats, and the incredible finding of that lead tablet, then please look at another article while you're here.
