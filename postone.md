# Post about visualizing the sacred

Today I finished reading a chapter of visualizing the sacred, it's interesting how much of a debate over Mississippian tools there are, especially in the 1940’s.
It's also very interesting how in these seemingly small circles with a select few people who actually do papers, they were talking and debating using the word cult to describe Mississippian artwork and culture in general. But something that in very cool is all of the work that people have done since the forties until this book was written to disprove the ‘cult from mexico’ theory and find something elts to call the mississippian culture and artwork, along with all of the more recent discoveries of how they found regional differences in the artwork itself. Thanks for reading, and make sure to check out some of our other articles!
