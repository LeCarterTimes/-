#### Cornbread. A word that not many say or even think about every day, but I think about every day. I say this weird word, “cornbread” every day. I think about it every day, when I get up and when I get down. When I work and when I don't. I say this word more times a month than most people say in a year. I am the Cornbreader *plays dramatic music
But in all seriousness though i do like making just the right cornbread every morning. I've actually been trying to get the most gooey soft cornbread I can, but for now I guess I'll just have to stick to tea and bread. If anyone has any good recipes for good gooey barely cooked cornbread, go ahead and comment the recipe on my youtube channel; LeCarterTimes!

Something more important however was the most recent chapter of Visualizing the Sacred, which I did enjoy reading, but holy! What a long book! The most recent chapter i read was 30 pages long, with each page displaying just raw scientific facts about 
Petroglyphs, or carving an image into a rock. It is interesting how this book asserts that the Dhengians, a group of tribes that the Osage are a part of/descend from,  actually founded the big mound city of Cahokia, built by the mississippian culture. Now this book states that the Dhegians also migrated southward, taking along with them their culture, which is why there are more mississippian symbols down south as time progresses. Now i dont think this is necessarily wrong, but I do think it is somewhat biased. This person specifically talked to the osage about their legends and has drawn a link to them and mississippian culture, and i dont think its wrong, but i do think it's a little ignorant to say “this was the people who did it, end of story” because these symbols stretch across from Etowah to Cahokia, which is saying from the great lakes to north georgia. Now he's not entirely wrong, there are some links between the two cultures, but I think there's more to the story.

But something on a light note, I am also learning how to play the trumpet!
I can already play a few songs but if you're a beginner like me, you might have some questions about the physical aspect of playing it. So I will discuss some of the things I faced: first off you may be asking “how do I actually play the thing?” Well the answer is instead of trying to make a “buzzing sound” like everyone on youtube says, you wanna try to make a kind of a humming or vibrating sound when your lips are on the mouthpiece. Another thing you may be asking is “well how do i go up or down in notes?” Well the answer to that one is you CAREFULLY make the hole that you're breathing out smaller for higher notes and larger for deeper notes. One more thing I will touch up on is the ability to read music sheets for songs. Now i still actually have to learn how to do this but just barely reading the notes makes it much easier

Well i hope those tips about the trumpet helped, and i hope my opinions about ‘Visualizing the Sacred’ were interesting, and I am honestly just glad to get my daily struggles about being the Cornbread vigilante this town needs off my chest. If you like this article, check out my others, Cheers!
