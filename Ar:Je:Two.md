# Journal 01

#### Hi! Thanks for reading this, for anyone who doesn't know, this is my journal post where I speak about things that interest me, like how I am going to season a molcajete, the process i do to get work done, and just my general opinion about web development. If you like this kind of content,go ahead and look at more! thnx!

So, today I started properly seasoning a molcajete! (for any who don't know, a molcajete is a mexican mortar and pestle.) the way i can tell that you have to season it is you need to fill the bottom up with rice, mash it up then throw it away. Then what you have to do is mash up some new rice, before rinsing it all out and rubbing it all head to toe with a clove of garlic, so that the entire thing is coated and you won’t get any dust in your food! But something that I REALLY wanna do with my molcajete is mash up some meat, beans, and just cook them up on my skillet to make some beef refried beans! My tummy is already grumbling!

Something I do want to get done in the meantime before I do the molcajete is getting my work done. Now I don't have a lot of work, but it seems so long! I find that it honestly feels easy, but for some reason it takes me forever! But I actually just think I have to practice more at this to really get the hang of actually doing work and studying. Because every hour I take not doing the work, I am losing an hour for fun. But off of the serious stuff! I actually really enjoy my work, especially writing this article post for y'all to see!

“But wait, this is a part of your work?” Well, yes it is! I have to write one article a day about really anything, and one a day about a certain book i really like to read (go ahead and look at that down in the description, if you like) and it is quite fun when i do, because i get to get out my feelings every day about the stuff i do! Something I am working on is this site, which  I am constantly working on to improve. Now at the time that this article is being written, my site is quite bare, but I do hope to get it looking prettier soon. Web development is quite honestly pretty easy, you just have to do it once a day and you will get better at it!

But if you like this, and more specifically me journaling about random things like my process for properly seasoning a mexican mortar and pestle (a molcajete), just my general feelings about work, or me talking about my process of web development, than please go ahead and look at some more articles i think you'll really enjoy, thanks!
