# Daily Journal 08

#### You know, I didn't get a lot done today. I mean I did, but it took forever. I actually feel a little dumb because of it, believe it or not. Other than that, not a lot to report on. Just kind of a sleepy day.

I actually finished pretty late today. What I mean is I was up a little late last night, fell asleep, and woke up pretty tired. I did all my things, like taking my dogs out etc but fell asleep again for like two hours and am still doing my work! Idk what it is but i am just not having a great day.

Other than that, I don't have a lot to report on. I still am going to post that video about that game I mentioned in my last journal entry, as it was a little stalled. Otherwise, kind of a slow day with not a lot of interest in it.

I actually feel a little dumb right now because I took SO long to get some simple word problems done out of a book I am reading about math. Do you know that feeling when you just stall on something forever and don't get it done? Well that's kind of what i feel right now.i do still have to remember that there's always a tomorrow to get things done quickly.

Anyway, if you like this kind of content hit the like button, or something. Aside from that, i.e. talking about being sleepy and feeling a little dumb, I'm probably going to finish up my work in a bit and do a few things before going to bed. Thanks for reading, and don't forget to check out another article while you're here, Cheers!
