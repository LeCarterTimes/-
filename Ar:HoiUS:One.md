# This is the preface to the book, A History Of The Indians Of The United States. In this article I want to touch up on some of the apparent racism in this book, the time in which it was written, and the early life of the author Angie Debo. I thank you for reading this article, and without adieu, let's get into it!
 
#### Ok, so in this preface, I notice the apparent racism that, while this person is trying to be professional, is still quite apparent. This person, Angie Debo, has brought up  terms that may be quite offensive today. Some of them are: fullblood, Creeks, 	and the quote “superior race”.

It is worth noting that some of the terminology used back when this book was written may be viewed as racist or ignorant today. Examples that I used above are creeks, which nowadays prefer to be called Muskogee, or the term full blood or half blood, which depending on who you ask is an offensive term used today. There will be many more sayings and terms which may be offensive today, but I will still try to keep an open mind and write my opinions about the book as I read on. So just because the writer may use terms like full blood, Creek or Indian, we still have to take into account the terminology that was used back in those days and use an open mind to assess those things fairly and justly, taking into account what the writer meant and the ideas they were trying to present. 

Now I do recognize that this was a different time, as this book was first published in March of 1984, a time that was maybe not as friendly to Native Americans as today. We also have to take into account the age of the writer, Angie Debo, who was 94 years old when she wrote this book and whose family had actually moved out to Indian country in 1899-1900, when she was just nine years old, ten years after it was legal for non Natives to move there at all. These facts combined creates a picture of who Angie Debo was, a woman who, though she was white, still tried to learn and try at least understand what Natives in Indian country had and were still going through with the resources she had available and the terminology used at the time.

Understanding these things, I will continue to post articles on this book and the many fascinating ideas that it holds. If you liked this content, specifically the apparent racism used back then, understanding the terms used which may invoke thoughts of racism, and the early life of the author Angie Debo which may shed some light onto why she may have used some of these terms, then please go ahead and look at another article while your here.
