# Pottery

Pottery is a word that comes to mind when you think about a possible gift, maybe a pottery kiln, or possibly clay itself, but pottery is much more than that! Pottery is the process by which clay is turned into a vase, a gift, or in ancient times an essential tool. But if not most importantly it is a way to associate and render your artistic self and dreams onto a physical item such as a vase, mug, plate or more! Pottery was and still is an essential practice in some places in the world, especially in places where it is done as an artform, not just because you want to make one clay mug! so if you wanna make your own pottery, try to do it in a way that's unique, inspiring, and just plain fun because that way youâ€™ll be recognized for your work! 

but all that aside, pottery is an amazing tool that helps people do things and create things that can be as beautiful as they are useful! In ancient times all throughout the world people used pottery because it offered an easy, cheap, and effective way to get a tool that could save lives, and yes can save lives. Because how are people supposed to purify water from a stream, if not by boiling it in a fire proof pot! And how are you supposed to cook if you can't afford a metal pan! but even though it served a survivalistic purpose, pottery also served the purpose of giving artist a artistic outlook to convert their dreams, stories, events and even religious stories, in fact some people even charted out the stars on them! It suffices to say that pottery serves many purposes, not just holding things!

But pottery doesn't just serve a purpose of letting ancient artists tell stories or letting the average joe be able to cook, you can use it too! Pottery is a way to sit back, relax, and enjoy the  time! Because between getting all the gear, getting the clay, and just shaping it into whatever you can dream of, pottery really creates a outlet or just a happy place for many people in the world! In fact one reason i just love clay and pottery in general is because i like the idea of just sitting down, getting the muddy clay between my hands and molding it into something gorgeous, in fact clay is so fun to mess around with i've spent hours just chilling and trying to see what i can make. It's really amazing trying to see what you can make! Once i've even just sat around in my yard in the clay making a small little city (i had a clay deposit back there) only to have it destroyed a day later, and thats (at least) one reason to enjoy it!
