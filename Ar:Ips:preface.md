# Preface of ‘In Plain Sight’ by Gloria Farley

#### Something that is really quite interesting to me is some of the possible evidence that suggests a pre-columbian connection of the new world, i.e. the Americas, to the old world, most of Asia, Africa and europe. And this isn't just some theory of ‘did the vikings come’, no this is real proof of trans atlantic and trans pacific trade, and yes, you heard me right, trans pacific. There are things like ancient Hebrew found in a Tennessee mound, ancient brass rings, and even cocaine found in King Tut's tomb, so if any of this is interesting to you, I'll go ahead and introduce some of the people responsible for these discoveries.

Henriette Mertz, a lawyer, was looking at the Smithsonian, when she saw something strange. She was looking at an excavation of a Tennessee mound when she recognized something, and that something would turn out to be an early Hebrew script. But that's not all that was discovered from this.

Huston mcCulloch, an economist, had the enthusiasm and curiosity to look into this report, which yielded something big. This thing would be copper rings, which he had examined, only to find out they were not made of copper, but instead an old world brass composition. He also had some wood found at the sight dated, which gave him the date of the 1st-2nd century A.D.


All these discoveries are amazing, but you may say to yourself, “we are only finding things from the old world in the new, what about the new world in the old?” well that's the thing, we are finding things from the new world in the old. A prime example of this is tobacco, along with cocaine, which was found in the tomb of well known pharaoh, king Tut. Can you imagine that, a teenage Tut smoking from a pipe and doing cocaine? I can't. 

But all that aside, this book really is interesting. If you want to read more about this book, specifically on topics about ancient excavations, old world connections, and even the pre columbian trans atlantic-pacific trade, then i would look out for another article, if i were you. If you enjoyed this article and want to support me, go ahead and share this with a friend. Thanks!
