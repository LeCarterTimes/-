# My review of the first chapter of ‘The Odyssey’ by Homer

#### This book, the Odyssey by Homer, has actually somewhat reminded me of when I was a little kid, reading Greek myths all the time. I swear I must have read almost all of them by the time I was ten, but starting to read this book has introduced me to a whole new world of Greek thought. I appreciate you coming along with me as I write my thoughts about a whole host of greek ideas such as their ideas about their gods, how they viewed their world, and their way of inheritance that i honestly haven't thought about in years. Without adieu, let's get into it!

Something that I find weird is the ancient Greek idea of their gods. What I mean is that it is so interesting that in their world, the gods are just like people, they  feel things like jealousy, love, desire, hatred, grudges and more. It's so interesting to me that they thought of their gods in such a way that it honestly begs the question, did the philosophers who invented and continued the idea of the Greek gods think of themselves as divine figures? I really don't know.

Another Thing that is quite interesting just from reading the first chapter is that the Greeks obviously viewed the outside world with a good bit of mystery. It is evident that the greeks, just from reading their literature, obviously thought that there were mysterious natural geological features on the earth, like that there was a end to the earth, that there was a literal hell that you could go into via a cave, and many more beliefs that seem just so weird to us today.

But something that is just straight foreign to me is their inheritance system. So Telemachus’s father, Ulysses, has just vanished, not to be seen and is assumed dead. So his son would be in line to inherit everything, right? Well no, he wouldn't because even though his father is still missing and presumed dead, there are suitors trying to impress his mother to marry her, so this means in the ancient greek world, if you marry the widow of a king who is vanished, you automatically become the new king, but if the king is dead, his son becomes the new king because he is known to be dead and you buried him in a burial mound. The Greek system is so weird!

But something I must note is the poetry involved. I mean, the book is written from a perspective of someone who has had a lot of experience with the arts, poetry, and other classical western art and philosophy (no duh, it was written by Homer) but i must admit that the art itself is quite impressive and expressive to read, not just from the perspective of “oh this is classic western art, so it must be good”, as i can imagine that Homer, while writing this, must have had a good bit from his own life to draw from to write this. But this has just been my review of the first chapter of the Odyssey, so if you like things like discussing the ideology of the greeks, their limited but albeit interesting beliefs about the world around them, or understanding their social structure, then go ahead and share this with a friend, or if you want you can see another one of our articles, Thanks!
