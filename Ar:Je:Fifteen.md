#### First off I wanna say Shabbat shalom, and thanks for reading!
This entry does not have a lot to report on, but i think i should still tell. I hope to get the rest of this work done by the end of the day, so I can start cooking. I'm going to tell you about three things: the challah I want to make, the food I am going to prepare, and my recipe for deviled eggs!.

Ok so first, i need to make challah for Shabbat. The recipe will include: one egg, a BUTT ton of sugar, some salt, olive oil, and flour. Note, I do not use measuring cups. So I mix a good bit of sugar and flour together, and a few dashes of salt, then I will add the olive oil, egg and water and mix well. Knead a little bit and put on a baking tray for twenty to thirty minutes, depending on how dark you like your bread, and wam bam thank you ma'am. Note your dough should be shaggy at first, then get stretchier as you go.

Next I want to boil some chicken for around forty minutes or an hour, or until done and fall off the bone. Now the way i do this is i put like four or five in a pot, boil for a while and serve up! Note I am going to try adding so much salt that the water is light gray.

And the next thing that I'm gonna make is some deviled eggs. So first I bring the water with the eggs up to a boil, then reduce it to medium heat and let it go for ten minutes. Then I take them out and put them in an ice bath. What I do next is cut the eggs vertically, making two deviled egg templates, before I scoop out the yolk. I mix all the yellow yolk stuff and add some tapatio hot sauce, or challula if I want to feel the burn, and make sure to add some spices of your choice to the mixture! Then I scoop it all back into the white egg shells and smooth off the top, and voila!

If you liked that stuff then smash the like button! But in all seriousness though I do really appreciate you reading this article, it helps my self esteemâ€¦.. And the site, it really helps out the site! That's what I meant, yeah. Ok but actually though, I really enjoy writing this stuff so i can get my ideas out there and document what I do, like cooking deviled eggs, chicken for shabbat, and challah. Thanks for reading and Shabbat shalom!
