# My review of the second chapter of Visualizing the sacred 

I am reading the second chapter of visualizing the sacred, and this chapter is about the Osage and the way a man who is not apart of the tribe stayed with them for 40 days and learned some stories, how the Osage apparently say they originate from the stars, and how the osage belief system mainly centered around nature, but without adieu, lets jump in!

Ok so first off It's quite interesting how this man who wrote this chapter has just assumed that because he lived among the Osage, he is now a master storyteller and can evaluate their culture with authority. It is also weird that this man thinks he can just say that all of mississippian culture originated from that of the osage. But by far something that i found insulting was the fact that this man, from thinking “ha ha, i have lived among the osage now for a massive 40 DAYS i can now add onto their charts that were generously given to me other parts of their legends which i think are applicable” and i just think that's whack.

Something else that is interesting to me is the fact that the Osage apparently say they are one of seven clans that originate from the stars. I do think it's interesting that they say they come from the stars and that they believe all these things like the sun birthing the stars and a bunch of other things every day and then she jumps around and lets them hop back in. It was somewhat weird  in my opinion how this man described this story, but it's very important to note that this man was retelling stories from another source then having to remember it all for a book.

Something that I think is quite neat however is the fact that this man who is writing this chapter did in fact have material to work off of, because like I mentioned earlier he did have two charts that were amazingly written 150 years apart that still showed roughly the same belief structure of the osage. I do think it's interesting that the osage belief system is somewhat similar to that of the norse with a main tree and its roots, all having several levels in between them with spirits on each. I do note how the Osage seem to believe that their natural world and physical morph in a way and everything is connected via this great tree, truly interesting.

But overall, I just enjoy reading this book. It gives me such a good way to visualize cultural spread of both the mississippian culture, and that of the osage, with their cosmology and belief that everything is related, the fascinating story of how the sun rises everyday and how they came from the stars, and how they let a foreigner to their culture cook for them and tell him their stories. Very cool book overall
