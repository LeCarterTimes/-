# Daily Journal 13

#### Ok so i don't have a ton to report on, just a few things about an update i just made. Those things are some new hubs I opened, along with some layout changes and clickable article images. I will be adding more things, like a search bar and others but for the next week or so things will stay the same.

Ok so, I have added several updates to the site, mainly the addition of three new hubs and a hopefully improved layout. The three hubs I added were: outdoor survival, A History Of Indians In The United States by Angie Debo, and Boy Scouts of America. In addition to this, I have another hub planned for the 30th to 32nd so watch out for that!

One of these new hubs, outdoor survival, is going to be aimed at providing outdoor survival related things, such as finding clay for pottery, finding flint for arrowhead making, and much more. Another article hub that has been added is the hub for A History Of Indians In The United States by Angie Debo, as to add to the native american themed books that i am currently reading. I plan to add another called ‘In Plain Sight’ within the next few days.

I have also updated the site where now, you can click on the actual images of the article hubs and it will take you straight there. Future updates will include a contact page, a search bar and an update to the UI so as to render on mobile devices better. Other than these updates to the site, my day has been pretty ok.

This article in my opinion is a little dry, but i think it is still important. If you like content such as hearing about the new additions to the site, a glimpse of what is to come, and what is already here, then please go and look at another article while you're here. If you want to support the site then please go and share this with a friend, or check out our new youtube channel while you have a minute! Thanks!
