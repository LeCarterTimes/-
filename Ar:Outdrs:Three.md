# Finding flint, a beginners guide

Flint, what is it? What does it look like? Where to find it? These are all questions that I am going to explain to you and more! But first off, why am I interested? Well because first off i am a survivalist, i enjoy all things fire, shelter and hunting, and what better way to hunt than to create and to build your very own arrowheads! And yes, flint is used in the process of flintknapping where you strike flint in a very special way and eventually turn it into an arrowhead/spearhead.
And second is well, finding and knapping flint is where my happy place is. I mean you get to go outside and find it, you get to put your feet on grass and feel the environment! It's very amazing.

Anyways flint is a mineral that is oftentimes used for knapping stone arrowheads, and yes, I know the name is misleading. I mean, it's a stone tool but it's only made of one material? That's weak! But in reality stone tools aren't made of that one type of rock! And I know what I just said but hear me out. Flint is a material that's found in many places in the world and is formed by quartz crystal shards piling up on each other in a riverbed or streambed forming a kind of crystal net shape that gives flint its natural breaking characteristics that allow it to be knapped! But flint is usually black so what happens when other material gets mixed into the crystal net? Well that creates chert, and the only difference between flint and chert is in color. They should act the exact same, except if there are any impurities, but that's another topic.

Ok, so you're hyped about flint, maybe you researched how to knap or you already know how, but how do you actually identify flint? Well there are many different ways to identify it, like for instance some say that if you hit it with another another rock it sounds different than if you hit it on a normal rock, and others say that its outer surface is smooth so that's how to identify it, but in my opinion the easiest way to find it is to go out and see and ask these questions; does the inner rock have a shiny glass like feeling to it? Does the inside break off in straight smooth lines? Does the outside have a buttery smooth feel like if a river rock was extremely wood-feeling? Is there a combination of the outside feeling wood-smooth with an inside that's a different color than the outside and somewhat glass-like and is breaking off in straight lines? Does the inside have a strange hardness where it's very strong but is very brittle? Well you may have flint! (or chert, it's very normal)

But lastly, how on earth do I even find such a miracle material? Well the answer may be in your local forest, on your local mountain or even in your backyard! The areas I would personally look first are on the shore of a dried stream or river, where you can see  the entire shore or river bed. Flint builds up on riverbeds or on river shores where you can sometimes identify it by it  sometimes being cracked open or with any other method, but it doesn't really matter how you identify it, it just matters where you look. So if you want to look near a water source that has lots of pebbles or boulders that line the shore (you may have to look for a while) you should walk up and down the shore until you find it. And yes it's really that easy! Another place I would look is on mountains or valley floors as sometimes there is an ancient stream of river that flowed through there and may have left some remains of flint buried under or on the surface. And anything goes! I once found a flint on a beach because there was a river that opened up to the ocean 100 feet away! Flint can be anywhere, anytime and any place as long as water flowed through on its rear! It's even found at the bottom of the ocean because of water that flowed over it! You can even find it in limestone because of the nature of how it was formed!


Flint truly is a marvelous thing that can be found anywhere. It's so great that cultures around the world on all the continents in all ethnicities and religions use it today! Flintknapping is an artform that has been around from just about when humans were created, in fact humans first tools were ones made of stone and i.e. flint/chert tools! And because of all the different people who make things with it and all the styles used to make those things,  it's important to preserve these practices from your people, so if your grandpa taught you this skill or your father or whoever, it won't be forgotten and we have to start from scratch! so i hope the material and really the tool of flint is understood so that you can start your own flint knapping journey soon and understand questions such as, such how do you even find it? How to identify it and what it even is. I hope you take something from this article and this knowledge and run with it straight to your nearest creek! Happy flint finding adventures!
