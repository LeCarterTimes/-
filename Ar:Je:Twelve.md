# Daily Journal 12

#### Ok so this article is going to be a little short, as i currently am under a time crunch. Ok so first off, Thanksgiving, which i don't know about you, but mine was pretty awesome. Second is that I stayed with some family for about five days, oh and I have a new article subject which I will be posting soon!

Ok so thanks giving, it was great! I traveled down with a family member to see my uncle, then we drove to another family member's house to have dinner, at which I showed some of my family the card game I had made. Now this has got me thinking, “man, didn't I say I was gonna post a video on that?” and well, yes, yes I am! In about four hours of posting this video, I will film this video live, at 6:30 Eastern Standard Time. don't miss it!

Although something that i did not expect was to stay for five days! But seriously though, I got to have fun and see some family and I am honestly glad to have been blessed in such a way that I get to see my elders and learn about my roots. Speaking of roots, although this is probably more of a metaphorical version, I was given a very special book on the archaeology and the trade of the old world and the pre-columbian new world, and yes, you heard my right, pre-columbian new world!

This book, called ‘In Plain Sight’ was gifted to me by my uncle, [professional archaeologist, Tom Cox], as a loan so I can read up on it and learn some of the fascinating subjects from it. But what subject is it about, you may be asking? It is about some of the newly and honestly quite ancient discoveries of old world languages written in stone, which have been dated to be far before Columbus's time. This book explores the many examples of runes, ancient libyan, phoenician, and even ancient Hebrew discovered across the new world, and all dated to be pre-columbian.

So if that kind of thing interests you, I would appreciate it if you go ahead and look at some of our articles on it. If you like topics such as me talking about my week, brand new videos and updates, and new articles coming out then please go ahead and look at another article while you're here.
