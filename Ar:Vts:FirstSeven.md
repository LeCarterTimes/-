# Review of the Seventh chapter of ‘Visualizing the Sacred’


### Something I enjoy is rocks. Now that might seem dumb, but what I am really interested in is the carved rocks! I find it interesting that this chapter of the book talks about the Thruston plate, a heavily carved rock found in Tennessee, especially the way in which they were carved, along with the interesting wear patterns found on the rock. It just fascinates me so much!

Now something that is really quite interesting is the fact that the Thruston tablet is about the size of a lunch tray, which is actually really cool given the limited number of stone tablets, not counting cave paintings,  which the Mississippian culture has produced. A much more of an emphasis was given to things like pottery, shell carvings(that is to say, the shells that they used were quite thick, often being about ¼ inches thick, which is so thick basically bone at that point, plus they were VERY intricate) and copper plates. Any way you slice it, this was a VERY huge discovery.

Something that I also find interesting is the things that were carved on the Thruston tablets, mainly the people themselves. There seem to be about six people on the tablet, at least the clearly visible ones, that are very well dressed, with regalia common in mississippian artwork.one of the pieces i want to mention is the Etowah plates, with their similar regalia, and several pieces of pottery, which also apparently has these things drawn on them.

A man named william H Holmes made a great observation, this was the fact that the Thruston tablet seems to have been re carved many times. This is apparent because there are many deeper lines and sections on the tablet that seem to be knocked out from the original. In addition to this, there are many weathered marks on it, just from the elements, but also from human intervention adding or taking certain things off.

These things done in stone really interest me, both because of the ancient secrets you can learn from them, and the ideas you can understand from them as a whole. I hope you enjoyed my in depth analysis of the first part of the seventh chapter of ‘Visualizing the Sacred’.
