### in this one i'm just gonna tell you about somethings that are going on with me right now. First off, I am adding more and more videos to the channel, so keep an eye out. Second, I am going to be posting a video on a game which mimics social and cultural politics, so go and check that out. And third I just feel happy that I have finally got all the things done that i'm supposed to get done. So without adieu, let's get into it!

Newsâ€¦. What is news? Why is the news? Why the freak haven't I posted any news at the time of writing this yet??... These are all questions in the world that need answering, but I won't answer because it's too much work. But if you want to help me with that, then go ahead and check out the site's new channel, LeCarterTimes! We post at least once a week many fields of content, from music to cooking! 

And speaking of videos, in about one hour there will be a post on the channel about a card game that, while still a card game, also represents geopolitics, human society and trade, and much more! So if you are interested in one of those fields, or are just interested in societal constructs and cultural behavior, then go ahead and check it out!

But something more serious though, do you ever just feel content? Just a feeling that everything is going good? Well I do. Of course there are thighs that could make me happier, like cleaning up a bit, practicing a hobby, or anything else, but I feel content.

If you feel content, I would appreciate it if you could share this article. If you feel interested in my  channel, or just wanna watch that video about the card game, go ahead and give it a visit. If you liked this article, go ahead and look at another while you're here, Thanks!
